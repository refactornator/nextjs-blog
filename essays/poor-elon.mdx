It's pretty sad to watch Elon Musk tear Twitter apart from his own ignorance. After years of my own therapy and hearing stories from plenty of other people about obsessively working to the point of cruelty to others. I can say with certainty that the drive to do that comes from a place of unhealed trauma. No one is “hardcore” about work, unless they deeply hate themselves and their current situation. Elon Musk is one of the richest men in the world and still suffers from unhealed trauma. No amount of money fixes a dysfunctional personality. In fact, it probably makes it worse.

Elon Musk has an obsessive need to prove himself. Show others that he is smart, funny, edgy, hard working. The list goes on. No one does that unless they are deeply insecure. And that insecurity comes from a lack of trust in himself and a lack of feeling safe around others.

It feels like watching a junior developer learn about software engineering, in real-time. But the consequences are catastrophic.
✅ Walk into a new codebase and declare every prior decision wrong and dumb
✅ Make outlandish statements to sound smart
✅ Argue with (in this case, fire) anyone who disagrees or makes him look bad

I don't know where this leads, but it feels like we're all being taken along for a ride. Like he's a child who wants friends to play with or to pick a fight with other school kids. He is crying out for attention and desperately needing approval from those around him. So much that he bought the biggest platform for cry babies and made himself king. He is running Twitter into the ground with no consideration for anyone along the way.

I used to enjoy Twitter very much. And friends of mine used to work there. And it was kind of a modern marvel of innovation. An idea crazy enough to work. I was always happy to see Twitter succeed, even if I didn't use it much. But if this is what Twitter has become: a platform for Elon rants. I hope it crumbles.
